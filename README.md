# Knucklebones
A very simple app for playing Knucklebones from [Cult of the Lamb](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1313140/Cult_of_the_Lamb/) on Android. 

This is a very simple project made quickly using Jetpack Compose for the purposes of just making a small thing as well as practicing making android apps

## Rules
* The game consists of two 3x3 boards, each belonging to their respective player
* The players take turns. On a player's turn, they roll a single 6-sided die, and must place it in a column on their board. A filled column does not accept any more dice
* Placing a die in a column will destroy all die of same value in the same column on other player's board
* Each player has a score, which is the sum of all the dice values on their board. The score awarded by each column is also displayed
* If there are several die of the same value in a column, their value gets multiplied by the amount of times they appear in that column
